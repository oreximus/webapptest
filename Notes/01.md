## Notes for Doing Pentest for the first time:

1. Do the Scanning with NMAP
	- Check the service and ports (look for any vulnerability if you find out)
	- Try to understand the first nmap scan (don't waste much time on it but)

2. In Website condition (which more likely occur but not compulsary)
	- Do the dir search through **dirbuster**(tool), **gobuster**(tool) or **feroxbuster**(tool) <-- three cool dirsearch tools.
	- look for any useful files and folder if you find out, specially the files or directory which more likely to be more data revealing (i.e. htaccess, etc)

3. If public exploit found then try to explore the web docs and other reports and Try to fetch information from your target through all of the info.
	- Try to be more practical and try different methods (in the decreasing order of efficiency).
	- Try not to use metasploit but use the searchsploit to check the available exploit.
